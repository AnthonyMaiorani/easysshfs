NOTE:
- If you are using SuperSu to manage root access and have no effect after mounting done, try to disable "mount namespace separation" option in SuperSU.
- It is highly recommended to create mount points in /data/media/0 on Android 4.2 and /mnt/runtime/default/emulated/0 on Android 6.0 and above.
