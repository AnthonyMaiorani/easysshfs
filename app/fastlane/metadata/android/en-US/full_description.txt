SSH Filesystem is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
Fuse 3.10.5.
Sshfs 3.7.1.
Ssh client from OpenSSH-portable 8.9p (with OpenSSL 1.1.1n).
For using public key authentication add "IdentityFile=<path>" to sshfs options. Password-protected keys are not supported.
Rooted device required (/dev/fuse in android is not allow for users except root).

Application source code: https://github.com/bobrofon/easysshfs

WARNING:
If you just want to have access to the files on your PC from your Android phone, then sshfs is a
VERY bad solution for that problem. You really need to know some internal details about Android
storage implementation to make something useful with sshfs. And EasySSHFS is not intended to hide
all these details from its users. Please try to use any implementation of Android document provider
for sftp protocol (or any other solution to work with sftp) before trying to use sshfs.

NOTE:
- If you are using SuperSu to manage root access and have no effect after mounting done, try to disable "mount namespace separation" option in SuperSU.
- It is highly recommended to create mount points in /data/media/0 on Android 4.2 and /mnt/runtime/default/emulated/0 on Android 6.0 and above.
