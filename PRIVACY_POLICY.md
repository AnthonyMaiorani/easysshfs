## Privacy Policy

Neither the EasySSHFS application itself nor third-party components inside of it collect or transmit any user data.
All data provided to the application by the user is stored locally on the user device.

**Why EasySSHFS doesn't collect user data?**

EasySSHFS is a free and open source project. It's implemented as a standalone application and doesn't imply any server-side components or services.
It's a non-commercial project, and the software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. There is no reason for the project to collect user data.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be updated with the future versions of the applications. Thus, you are advised to review this document periodically for any changes.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact [the developer](mailto:bobrofon@gmail.com).
